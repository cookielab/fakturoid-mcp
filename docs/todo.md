# TODO: MCP Server Implementation Recommendations

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Fakturoid MCP server implementation.

## ðŸ“‹ Recommendations

### âœ… High Priority (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Add Resource Support** - âœ… Implemented 10 contextual resources with `fakturoid://` URI scheme
- [x] **Add Prompt Templates** - âœ… Implemented 6 professional workflow templates

### ðŸš€ Medium Priority
- [ ] **Implement Discovery** - Dynamic tool listing
  - Add runtime tool discovery based on available API endpoints
  - Implement conditional tool registration based on account capabilities
  - Create dynamic schema generation for tools

- [ ] **Add Sampling** - Provide example API responses
  - Add sample responses for each tool in tool descriptions
  - Include example resource data in resource metadata
  - Provide sample prompt outputs for better AI model understanding

- [ ] **Error Improvements** - More structured error responses
  - Add specific error types for different Fakturoid API errors
  - Implement structured error objects with error codes and contexts
  - Add user-friendly error messages with suggested actions

- [ ] **Testing** - Add comprehensive test suite
  - Unit tests for all tools, resources, and prompts
  - Integration tests for MCP protocol communication
  - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
  - Mock Fakturoid API for reliable testing

### ðŸ”§ Low Priority
- [ ] **Code Refactoring** - Reduce tool registration boilerplate
  - Create automated tool registration based on decorators or metadata
  - Extract common patterns into reusable utilities
  - Simplify tool definition syntax

- [ ] **Performance** - Add caching for frequently accessed data
  - Cache account information and user data
  - Implement smart caching for recent invoices/expenses
  - Add cache invalidation strategies
  - Consider Redis for distributed caching

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Notes

**Completed Features:**
- âœ… **Resources**: 10 contextual data sources providing real-time business context
- âœ… **Prompts**: 6 workflow templates for common accounting tasks
- âœ… **Consistent Architecture**: Clean separation of tools, resources, and prompts

**Next Steps:**
1. Focus on **Discovery** and **Sampling** for better AI model integration
2. Improve **Error Handling** for production robustness  
3. Add **Testing** infrastructure for reliability
4. Consider **Refactoring** and **Performance** optimizations

This roadmap transforms the server from a basic tool provider into a comprehensive, production-ready MCP implementation.
